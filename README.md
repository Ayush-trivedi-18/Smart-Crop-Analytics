# SmartCropAnalytics  
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts crop yields using a dataset with agricultural parameters. The code is designed to be user-friendly and easy to understand while delivering accurate yield predictions. This tool can assist in making informed agricultural decisions, promoting food security, and enhancing sustainable farming practices.

## Purpose  
The primary goal of this project is to simplify crop yield prediction using machine learning models. By analyzing key agricultural factors such as rainfall, fertilizer usage, and crop types, this project helps improve agricultural planning and resource optimization.

## Key Features of the Dataset  
The dataset includes the following attributes:  
- Crop: Type of crop being grown.  
- Crop_Year: The year the crop was cultivated.  
- Season: The growing season (e.g., Kharif, Rabi).  
- State: state where the crop was grown.  
- Area: Land area used for cultivation (in hectares).  
- Production: Quantity of crop produced (in metric tons).  
- Annual_Rainfall: Annual rainfall in the region (in mm).  
- Fertilizer: Amount of fertilizer applied (in kilograms).  
- Pesticide: Amount of pesticide used (in kilograms).  
- Yield: The target variable, representing production per unit area.

## Models Used  
This project employs the following machine learning models:

1. Gradient Boosting Regressor:  
   - Captures complex patterns for accurate predictions.  
   - Suitable for datasets with intricate relationships.

2. Decision Tree Regressor:  
   - A straightforward and interpretable model.  
   - Provides a visual representation of decision paths.

3. Support Vector Regressor (SVR):  
   - Uses kernel methods for non-linear relationships.  
   - Includes preprocessing for numerical and categorical data.

## Evaluation Metrics  
The models are evaluated using:  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Reflects the average squared error of predictions.  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors.

## Visualizations  
- Scatter Plots: Visualize the relationship between actual and predicted yields.  
- Correlation Heatmaps: Highlight interactions among features.

## How to Run  
1. Prepare the Dataset:  
   - Ensure the dataset `synthetic_crop_yield.csv` is in the project directory.

2. Install Dependencies:  
   - Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary libraries.

3. Run the Code:  
   - Execute `Smart-Crop-Analytics.py` to train and evaluate models.

4. Analyze Results:  
   - Review performance metrics and visualizations generated by the code.

## Insights  
This project showcases how machine learning can simplify and improve crop yield prediction. Its adaptable design allows for application to other agricultural or environmental datasets, fostering innovation in data-driven farming solutions.

## Future Enhancements  
- Integrate weather forecasts and soil data for improved accuracy.  
- Develop a web-based interface for real-time predictions.  
- Experiment with advanced models like Neural Networks or XGBoost.
